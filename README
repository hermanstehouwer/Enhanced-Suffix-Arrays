Suffixarray package

Licenced under the GPLv3, see the LICENCE file.

INTRODUCTION:

This package implements an efficient suffixarray in template-based C++.
Space utilisation for a corpus of lenght N is N*sizeof(index) + 4N*sizeof(char) + exceptions.
(where index is defined as the type used to index the corpus, usually an unsigned int for std::vector and std::string)
(Exceptions are fairly rare, we store most indexes as relative indexes and the longest-common-prefix values as characters)
In high-LCP corpora this implementation will not be very efficient.
Natural Language data is stored very efficiently, which was our goal.

Buiding the suffix array is fairly efficient time-wise using a deep-shallow sorting strategy with a blind trie.
(Much faster than C++'s regular sort function, due to the nature of the datastructure.)

The class over which one builds the suffix array must:
	- Be some sort of list.
	- Support the < operator on its elements.
	- Support the at(i) and [i] access methods.
	- Support random access iterators, specifically begin() and end()
	- Have printable elements. (i.e. std::cerr << ....)

A simple class that supports these is std::string.
Also a std::vector<string> or std::vector<int> would be suitable.
In fact wordstring.h and intstring.h provide exactly these classes, with added operator overloading for easy inputstream conversion.

This suffix array library provides the following core functionality once the suffix array is build:
	- Is the query an infix of the read-in corpus.
	- Answer how often the query occurs in the corpus.
	- Answer where all the positions of the query in the corpus are.
	- Do the same for skipgrams.
These questions are answered very efficiently by using the implicit suffix tree structure on the suffix array.

USAGE:

A simple usage example is given in the file main.cpp.
This example reads in a corpus (a list of whitespace seperated strings) as given on the commandline.
HAving build the suffix array it will listen to stdin for queries (without wildcards) and answer them
with the number of occurences in the corpus.

General usage of the suffix array:
1.	Fill some sort of list on which you want the suffix array build.
	(for example a string or a list of strings).
2.	Add a unique, largest element to the back of the list.
	For example numeric_limits<int>::max() to a list of integers.
	This is needed for the algorithm to work.
3.	Construct a suffixarray of the type suffixarray<listtype> and construct it with the prebuild list.
4.	Query the suffix array for information. Several functions are provided for this in the library.
	The initial function declarations are well documented.
	For example:
	  // find_all_positions_count finds the number of positions of
	  // substring w occurring in the suffix array.  wildcard indicates
	  // which element_type should be considered the wildcard element.
	  // Wildcards match any one element_type.
	  // size_type
	  // find_all_positions_count( const value_type& w, element_type wildcard = element_type());
	It is important to note that the wildcard is by default the default value of the element_type of the list on which the suffix array is build.
	For a list of integers this means 0.
	_Do_Not_ use this value in your original input list as this will break your queries (unless you use a different wildcard than the default).

To simply get counts of specific queries in a plaintext, whitespace-seperated corpus without anotations simply.
- make
- ./main -f corpusfile
- type queries on the stdin and get your counts on the stdout.

All comments are welcomed.

If you use the library for a software project or for research I would love to know your results.
